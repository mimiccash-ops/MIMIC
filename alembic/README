# MIMIC Database Migrations (Alembic)

This directory contains database migration scripts managed by Alembic.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Create a new migration after model changes
alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Add new column to users"

# Apply all pending migrations
alembic upgrade head

# Rollback the last migration
alembic downgrade -1

# View migration history
alembic history

# View current database version
alembic current
```

## Directory Structure

- `versions/` - Contains migration scripts
- `env.py` - Alembic environment configuration
- `script.py.mako` - Template for new migration files

## Best Practices

1. Always review auto-generated migrations before applying
2. Test migrations on a development database first
3. Include both `upgrade()` and `downgrade()` functions
4. Use meaningful migration messages
5. Never modify applied migrations

## Integration with Existing Migrations

The project includes manual migration scripts in the root directory
(migrate_*.py). Consider consolidating these into Alembic migrations
for a single source of truth.
